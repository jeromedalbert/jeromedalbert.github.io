{% img left personal-photo /images/pages/jerome.jpg Probably me. %}

My name is Jerome Dalbert. I'm originally from Bordeaux, France, but I have
moved quite a bit.

After studying computer engineering in Toulouse (where _Airbus_ planes are
designed and assembled), I worked on websites and booking/retail systems as a
Java/JEE engineer for "big bad corporations" in Paris. Nobody's perfect!

After a while I moved to London to work for a small startup. It was
also my first significant Ruby experience and I enjoyed it: this language
is simple, expressive, and frameworks like Rails make you very productive.

Now I work in San Francisco for a startup called <a href="https://stackshare.io" target="_blank">StackShare</a>,
where I develop various Ruby and Ruby on Rails applications. Who knows what will happen next?
