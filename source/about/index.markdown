{% img left personal-photo /images/pages/jerome.jpg Probably me. %}

My name is Jerome Dalbert. I'm originally from Bordeaux, France, but recently I have moved a bit.

I studied computer engineering in Toulouse (where _Airbus_ planes are designed and assembled) and began my professional career in Paris.
Now, I'm a Frenchman in London!

I am currently a software engineer at <a href="https://www.rentify.com" target="_blank">Rentify</a> where I develop various Ruby and Ruby on Rails applications.
Before that, I worked on websites and booking/retail systems as a Java engineer (Spring, JEE, etc). Nobody's perfect !
Joking aside, I enjoy developing in Ruby: it is fun, terse, leverages powerful paradigms, and the community really cares about software craftsmanship.
