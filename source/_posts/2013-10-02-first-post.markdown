Hi everyone, welcome to my blog!

Let me tell you an inspiring story of honor and glory.

**June:** the idea of creating a blog springs in my little head.<!--more-->  
**Early July:** I start talking about it to a couple of people.

**July, August, September:** ???

**End of September:** a fellow coworker asks me how far I am into this blog
project.  
I realize I was vegetating the whole time, watching all of the Doctor Who
series.

**One day later:** I frenetically spend my whole Saturday + half of the night
creating and customizing this blog...  
Motivation comes in mysterious ways !


## So, what is this blog going to talk about ?

Contrary to what it may seem, this is not a Ruby only blog: I just found the
logo cool. This is a tech blog at the moment. I will post some day-to-day
discoveries and tips and tricks, share my thoughts about software craftsmanship
(or whatever this pontificating word means) and maybe talk about life as an IT
professional in general.

## What can I do to help ?

How thoughtful of you to ask this question. I doubt having any reader at all,
but if so, do not hesitate to contribute with a comment.
