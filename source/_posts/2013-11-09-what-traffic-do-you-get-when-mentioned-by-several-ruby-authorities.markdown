It looks like my latest blog post, [A Diagram of the Ruby Core Object Model](/a-diagram-of-the-ruby-core-object-model), has had quite a bit of a success in the Ruby community.
Mostly in the educational sphere, that is, <!--more-->Ruby beginners (the targeted audience) but also... trainers!  
Well, as long as you guys cite your sources, it's fine by me!

It casually begins with a decent score on Reddit:

And then, the unexpected happens: I get retweeted by Matz, the creator of Ruby! I can die in peace now. Minaswan.

So I decide to try my luck on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com" target="_blank">Hacker news</a> but... Not a single vote was given that day. I realize
this website is more about general life and startup posts, important technology announcements, and provocative rants.

Finally, two weeks later, my post <a href="http://rubyweekly.com/archive/167.html" target="_blank">gets mentioned</a> in the revered Ruby Weekly newsletter! Definitely a lot of traffic coming from there.

In terms of metrics, in two weeks, I had 5000 hits, 70 related tweets, and a couple of new followers and e-mail messages.

Overall, I am surprised and humbled by the attention this post had. It looks like people want more of this kind of visual explanations: I admit it lacks a bit on the Internet.
